Attempts to solve AOC 2024


1. Not trying to make things super fast
2. Not handling errors parsing input
3. Trying not to use external libraries. Much. At least at the start.
4. Trying to make things readable :clown:
5. Iterators my beloved
6. Solutions are split into parsers and generators, the goal is to
   be able to reuse as much of existing code from part 1 in part 2
